# BindyAppDemo
Unity App demo based on supplied requirements

### Unity version

Due to lack of networking project experience I have structured the project as follows.

DataManager class issues the initial call to ApiController and subscribes to event upon succesfull response.
ErrorPanel class subscribed to error response
